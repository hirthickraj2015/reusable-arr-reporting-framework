## Define all constants that will be used throughout the script
# If you want to do a classic Snowball, looking across a static time period of x months, choose 'number_of_months'
    # The time period can be set using the month_period variable, with 12 the usual amount
# If you want to do a YTD or QTD snowball (starting from Jan or Q1/2/3/4), choose these options
# If you would like to do this but geared to the company's financial year, choose FYTD or FQTD
    # To do this, set the month in which a company's FY starts. Eg for JMAN, this is September so the value should be 9
